              <p class="card-text text-center">The feminism movement is not just for the women. It serves as a champion of all the marginalized in the forefront of the struggle for gender equality. It is not something to he ashamed of carrying if you are a man.

              <h3 class="text-center">My commitments</h3>
              <p class="card-text text-center">Violence against women and girls is rooted in gender-based discrimination and social norms and gender stereotypes that perpetuate such violence. Given the devastating effect violence has on women, efforts have mainly focused on responses and services for survivors. However, the best way to end violence against women and girls is to prevent it from happening in the first place by addressing its root and structural causes. Prevention should start early in life, by educating and working with young boys and girls promoting respectful relationships and gender equality. Working with youth is a “best bet” for faster, sustained progress on preventing and eradicating gender-based violence. While public policies and interventions often overlook this stage of life, it is a critical time when values and norms around gender equality are forged.

              <p class="card-text text-center">We can all learn to be feminists. It takes some really severe sociological imagination... and a willing heart to serve the people. </p>

              <p class="card-text text-center">Prevention entails supporting the implementation of the agreed conclusions of the 57th Session of the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) that placed a strong focus on prevention through the promotion of gender equality, women’s empowerment and their enjoyment of human rights. It also means making the home and public spaces safer for women and girls, ensuring women’s economic autonomy and security, and increasing women’s participation and decision-making powers—in the home and relationships, as well as in public life and politics.Working with men and boys helps accelerate progress in preventing and ending violence against women and girls. They can begin to challenge the deeply rooted inequalities and social norms that perpetuate men’s control and power over women and reinforce tolerance for violence against women and girls. </p>

              <p class="card-text text-center">At a young age, youth should be exposed to all the issues being faced by the oppressed in their day to day living. We don't see it evidently, but women suffer a great deal. We must learn to take charge and re-educate the bullies and the tyrants. </p>

              <h3 class="text-center">My commitments</h3>
              <p class="card-text text-center">I can push for the following to be upheld by awareness groups that I can participate in: Understanding that violence against women is an equality rights and human rights issue. Recognize that male power is upheld by rape and sexual harassment; Stop racism/oppression; End poverty – NOW!</p>
