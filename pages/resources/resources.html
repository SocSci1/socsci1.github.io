                    Overall, 4 percent of women who have ever been pregnant have ever experienced physical violence during pregnancy. The incident increases slightly with number of living children; decreases slightly with age; decreases with education level; and declines steadily with wealth quintile.

                    Emotional and other forms of non-personal violence are the most common types of spousal violence (23% of ever-married women). One in seven ever-married women experienced physical violence by their husbands while 8 percent experienced sexual violence by their husbands. Patterns in prevalence of spousal violence are similar to those of violence experienced by woman 15-49. Most likely higher among separated, widowed and divorced; currently married women who have married more than once; and in CARAGA region, Central Visayas and SOCCSKSARGEN.

                    The 2013 report is so far the highest number of reported VAW cases since 1997. The trend, however, is not conclusive of a decreasing or increasing VAW incidence in the country because data are based only from what was reported to PNP. Across a ten-year period from 2004 to 2013, average violations of RA 9262 ranked first at 57 percent among the different VAW categories since its implementation in 2004. Reported cases under RA 9262 continue to increase from 218 in 2004 to 16,517 cases in 2013. Continuous information campaign on the law and its strict implementation may have caused the increasing trend. Since 2004, wife battering cases have been categorized under ‘Violation of RA 9262’ that is, if the victim files a case under such law, otherwise the reported cases will fall under physical injuries category. Physical injury is the second most prevalent case across the ten-year period, accounting for 19.7 percent of all reported VAW cases nationwide. Reported incidence of physical injury has been decreasing in the latter years. Its peak was in 2001 at 5,668 reported cases. The decrease can be partly attributed to the enactment into law of RA 9262 or Anti-VAWC Act of 2004 which penalizes abusive husbands and live-in partners. However, in 2009 and 2010 the reported cases show an increasing trend which slides back in 2011. The trend starts to increase again in 2012 and 2013. Reported rape cases which ranked third accounted for about 8.6 percent of total reported VAW cases from 2004 to 2013. Acts of lasciviousness ranked fourth at an average of 591 reported cases accounting for 5.5 percent of all reported VAW cases from 2004 to 2013. The comparative figures indicate an upward trend of the reported cases after a record low of 358 reported cases in 2007. Among the different regions, Region 6 (Western Visayas) posted the highest reported VAW cases from January to December 2013 with 4,833 reported cases, accounting for 20.3 percent of the total reported VAW cases nationwide. Region 11 (Davao) comes next at 4,411 (18.5%) reported VAW cases followed by Region 7 (Central Visayas) with 3,460 reported VAW cases or 14.5 percent of the total reported VAW cases nationwide. The Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) posted the lowest reported VAW cases with 86 cases in 2013.
